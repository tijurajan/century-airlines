Umbraco Membership
In the Umbraco backend, 2 member types are defined mainly:
1.	User		- Website users are associated to this Member group
2.	Admin		- Website admins are associated to this Member group
Content Restriction
Umbraco content restriction is implemented by page level access permissions and Umbraco web API Authorisations
Admin page (root) is accessible only for members belonging to group “Admin”
User-portal page is accessible only for members belonging to group “User” & “Admin”
Unauthenticated users will be redirected to Custom login page. This umbraco setup is as follows:
 
 

The custom Login page template post form to custom Umbraco Auth surface controller, which is an MVC controller that redirects users based on their roles.

The Admin Dashbord is rendered by Angular app as follows:

Angular forms are posted to respective umbraco web api endpoints which performs CRUD operation on the documents. For example, Flight list can be gathered by the angular HTTP services API endpoint:
